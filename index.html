        <p class="title">Why Slow Steiner?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are four affordable housing buildings with hundreds of eldery
            and disabled residents within two blocks of Duboce Park. Many have
            expressed fear over fast-moving cars and unsafe street crossings.
            Our neighbor Michael was recently hit in his wheelchair by a car
            speeding down Steiner and turning up Duboce Ave. A safer and slower
            Steiner would provide neighbors of all ages and abilites a safer
            connection to the park.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a part of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggle">The Wiggle</a>,
            Steiner between Duboce and Waller is a pedestrian and bike artery
            across the city. A Slow Steiner would better support these already
            common uses of Steiner by reducing motor vehicle traffic and speed,
            providing a safer corridor for pedestrians and bicylists.

          What is the background and context behind Slow Steiner?
        </p>
        <p>
          Slow Steiner has grown out of
          <a href="https://www.dtna.org/Duboce-Triangle-Vision-2030"
            >DTNA's Vision 2030 initiative</a
          >
          (formerly “Slow Triangle”). Grounded in the results of a series of
          community workshops and surveys starting in 2022 (<a
            href="https://www.dtna.org/resources/Documents/DTNA%20Slow%20Triangle%20Presentation%2020220903.pdf"

            >2</a
          >), efforts have been focused on improving pedestrian safety and
          traffic calming throughout Duboce Triangle. Over the past year, based
          on community input, particular attention has been given to Sanchez and
          Steiner, and in particular, the intersection at
          Duboce/Sanchez/Steiner.

          involved or make my voice heard?
